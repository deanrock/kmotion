** DEV NOTES **

removed "enable additional live image updates may increase server load in config
removed image quality & movie quality settings in config

bad shutdown still not recorded in logs properly !!!
update kmotion2 > kmotion3
update index.html preloads...



KM.enable_func_buttons ... what does it do ????????
make 'make pkg' create a zipped .js file


oh crap, remove all the default framerate and quality ... dont forget its in kmotion_setd as well as index.js in setting and syncing :)

upgrade code to install then remove then install FIFO's
upgrade the code to make a clearer message when kmotion shuts down due to no hdd room


fixed log bug: failure to consistently log incorrect shutdown
15 x 15 mask grid
fixed bug: allow virtual_conf mask file
mask all, invert, none buttons

I have found by setting "max_mpeg_time = 300" in virtual_motion_conf/threadXX.conf
that it works all the time now.

Check with "max_mpeg_time = 300", does the archive list miss some files ?
