***** AUTO INSTALL *****


The auto install script, try this first.

sudo ./install.py 
kmotion start

and if you want to uninstall

sudo ./uninstall.py



***** MANUAL INSTALL *****


If the automated install script fails for any reason you may want to try a 
manual install.

Where you find <path to kmotion dir>, substitute your path to kmotion your 
kmotion directory ie  in my case '/home/dave/kmotion' !!


(1)  Check the dependencies

kmotion v2 needs a minimum of :

apache2 ...             v2.2.x 
apache2 python module   v3.3.x
motion ...              v3.2.x
python ...              v2.4.x

If you are running Debian / Ubuntu or a derivative use the following command

apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-python motion python




(2)  Selecting the ramdisk location

kmotion needs a ramdisk directory to store frequently changing images, Normally 
this is in /dev/shm/ but if /dev/shm is less than 30MB (execute df -h) or your 
distro does not support ramdisks you can use any directory as a virtual ramdisk. 

Edit /<path to kmotion dir>/core/core_rc and change the ramdisk location to 
something like

ramdisk_dir = /dev/shm/kmotion_ramdisk ... or ...
ramdisk_dir = <path to kmotion dir>/www/virtual_ramdisk

*NOTE* definitely use a real ramdisk if you have a SSD (ie flash) drive




(3)  Install core

cd <path to kmotion>/kmotion
./install_core.py




(4) Modifying apache2 conf

Locate and edit your apache2 configuration file, normally its  
'/etc/apache2/apache2.conf' but may be under a different name or location 
dependent on your distro. At the end of the file add:

# Include kmotion vhosts directory
Include <path to kmotion dir>/www/vhosts/kmotion

In some .rpm based distros these have been instances of apache2 not reading the 
include. A workaround is to copy the entire contents of 
'<path to kmotion dir>/www/vhosts/kmotion' and add it to the end of the apache2 
configuration file.

This does mean that any changes to this vhosts file will not automatically be 
seen by apache2 and a manual re-copying will be needed. This will happen when 
you change kmotions port from 8085, change authentication system etc etc




(5) Restart apache2

Restart apache2, normally this is something like:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart  




(6) Moving the exe's

Move the kmotion exe's 'kmotion' and 'kmotion_ptz' to your path, ie 
'/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin' or '/bin' etc. The exe's can be found at 
<path to kmotion dir>.

cd <path to kmotion dir>
mv kmotion /usr/local/bin
mv kmotion_ptz /usr/local/bin




(7) Setting permissions and GID's

You need to change the permissions and the GID of the following to the UID of 
the apache2 user:

<path to kmotion dir>/www/fifo*
<path to kmotion dir>/www/servo_state
<path to kmotion dir>/www/mutex/*

Example:

dave@main-system:~$ ps -fC "apache2"
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      4161     1  0 Oct02 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data  4163  4161  0 Oct02 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data  4181  4161  0 Oct02 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data  4182  4161  0 Oct02 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
dave@main-system:~$ 

So we want 'www-data'

chgrp www-data <path to kmotion dir>/www/fifo* 
chmod 0660  <path to kmotion dir>/www/fifo* 

chgrp www-data <path to kmotion dir>/servo_state
chmod 0640 <path to kmotion dir>/servo_state

chgrp -R www-data <path to kmotion dir>/www/mutex
chmod -R 0770 <path to kmotion dir>/www/mutex




(8) Getting kmotion to start when your system starts

A 'kmotion start' needs to be executed as a normal user on system startup. There 
are many ways this can be done but my personal favourite is by using cron.

crontab -e
and add:
@reboot <path to kmotion exe's>/kmotion start &




(9) Start kmotion

kmotion start

Point your browser (hopefully firefox) to 'http://localhost:8085' OR 
'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8085' the default username is 'kmotion', the default 
password is 'kmotion'.
